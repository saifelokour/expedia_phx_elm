# About

## What I wanted to accompilish:
My goal was to create an application using both Elixir and Elm, two functional programming languages that I have been very interested in. I wanted to focus more on Elm because I have little to no experience with it. I was planning on designing a single page app that was fast and pleasant to use. However, my inexperience with Elm made that very challenging. If I had a little more time I would want to flesh out the site a lot more (it really isn't much of a website as you can see) but I didn't want to spend too much time on it.

## What I learned
Most of what I learned was about Elm, and the Elm architeture. Before starting I had done a little research on Elm and found a few tutorials, but I soon found that they were outdated. I was forced to dig deep into the documentation, and rely heavily on the Elm compiler, which was at times very helpful. I learned about Maybe's and how the Elm runtime deals with commands. 

## My Experience
I've been working with Elixir for over a year, so I'm very comfortable with the ecosystem, and I love it.

Elm on the other hand was something I found fasinating, but very enigmatic. After giving it a test run, I have to say I enjoyed it a lot more than having to deal with javascript and html. With a little more practice I think it has potential to be a powerful tool.
